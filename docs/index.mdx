title: "What is Acontext"
---

A great agent application should be able to:
- serve millions of users, not just a local demo.
- work for a long-period of time
- observe agent behavior
- learn from agent's own successes and failures.

Such an application is hard to build.

So we ask ourselves:
> “What's the core of helping developers to build a great agent application?”

That inspires us to create Acontext: **a context data platform for building cloud-native AI Agents**.
