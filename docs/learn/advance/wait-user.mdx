By default, Acontext will automatically learn skills from completed tasks. 
But this might not be what the user wants, some agent apps, like Manus, provide a way to let users decide whether to learn the skills or not.

Acontext also supports this.


## Enable User Confirmation
You can enable user confirmation by setting the `project_enable_user_confirmation_on_new_experiences` to `true` in the project settings.

```yaml config.yaml
project_enable_user_confirmation_on_new_experiences: true
```

## Obtain the Unconfirmed Experiences

Once you enable it, for every worth-learning experience, Acontext will wait for user confirmation before actually learning skills.
You can obtain the unconfirmed experiences by calling the `get_unconfirmed_experiences` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
experiences = client.spaces.get_unconfirmed_experiences(space_id=space.id)

for e in experiences.items:
    print(f"{e.id}: {e.experience_data}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const experiences = await client.spaces.getUnconfirmedExperiences(spaceId);

for (const e of experiences.items) {
    console.log(`${e.id}: ${JSON.stringify(e.experience_data)}`);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

You can render those experiences in UI and let users decide whether to learn the skills or not.

Experience data consists of the following fields:
```json experience_data
{
    "type": "sop",
    "data": {
        "use_when": "Implement google authentication",
        "preferences": "Use NextAuth;",
        "tool_sops": [
            {
                "tool_name": "ls",
                "action": "find the middleware folder",
            },
            ...
        ]
}
```

## Confirm the Experience
Once user decided, you can confirm the experience by calling the `confirm_experience` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Use this Experience
client.spaces.confirm_experience(space_id=space.id, experience_id=experience.id, save=True)
# Reject this Experience
client.spaces.confirm_experience(space_id=space.id, experience_id=experience.id, save=False)
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Use this Experience
await client.spaces.confirmExperience(spaceId, experienceId, { save: true });
// Reject this Experience
await client.spaces.confirmExperience(spaceId, experienceId, { save: false });
```
