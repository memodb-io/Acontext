title: Custom Skills for Long-term Memory
description: "Define how your agent remembers by writing SKILL.md files"
---

Every skill in a learning space has a `SKILL.md` that tells the learner how to organize information. By writing different SKILL.md files, you define different memory algorithms — each with its own rules for what to capture, how to name files, and how to structure entries.

## How It Works

When a session completes, Acontext's learning pipeline:

1. Reads each skill's `SKILL.md` to understand its purpose and rules
2. Decides which skills are relevant to the session outcome
3. Creates or updates files **following the instructions you wrote**

This means you control the memory format. The learner is just the executor.

## Example Skills

### social-contacts

One file per person — captures who the user knows, relationship context, and preferences for interacting with them.

<Accordion title="SKILL.md">
```markdown
---
name: "social-contacts"
description: "Track people the user interacts with — one file per person"
---
# Social Contacts

Maintain a file for each person the user mentions or interacts with.
Capture relationship context, communication preferences, and notable interactions.

## File Structure

One file per person, named [first-last].md (lowercase, hyphenated).
Create a new file the first time a person is mentioned; update it when new information surfaces.

File format for [first-last].md:
  # [Full Name]
  ## Basics — Relationship, Role, Company
  ## Notes — notable facts, preferences, or context about this person

## Guidelines

- One person per file — do not combine people
- Only record information explicitly mentioned by the user
- Update existing entries when corrections are provided
- Keep entries factual and concise
```
</Accordion>

### project-runbooks

One file per project — captures deployment steps, architecture decisions, and recurring issues.

<Accordion title="SKILL.md">
```markdown
---
name: "project-runbooks"
description: "Operational knowledge per project — deploy steps, architecture, common issues"
---
# Project Runbooks

Maintain a runbook for each project the user works on.
Capture deployment procedures, architecture decisions, and solutions to recurring problems.

## File Structure

One file per project, named [project-name].md (lowercase, hyphenated).

File format for [project-name].md:
  # [Project Name]
  ## Architecture — key components, services, dependencies
  ## Deploy — step-by-step deployment procedure
  ## Common Issues — each issue with Symptom and Fix

## Guidelines

- One project per file
- Update deploy steps when procedures change — do not keep stale instructions
- Add new issues as they are encountered and resolved
- Keep architecture notes high-level — link to external docs for details
```
</Accordion>

### api-error-patterns

Accumulated patterns organized by error category — captures what went wrong and how to fix it.

<Accordion title="SKILL.md">
```markdown
---
name: "api-error-patterns"
description: "Reusable patterns for handling API errors — organized by category"
---
# API Error Patterns

Collect error-handling patterns discovered during development.
Organize by error category so the agent can quickly find relevant solutions.

## File Structure

One file per error category, named [category].md (e.g., auth.md, rate-limits.md, timeouts.md).

File format for [category].md:
  # [Category] Errors
  ## [Pattern title] (date: YYYY-MM-DD) — with Symptom, Root Cause, Fix, Prevention

## Guidelines

- Group related errors in the same file — do not create one file per error
- Include the date so patterns can be reviewed for staleness
- Focus on reusable patterns, not one-off bugs
```
</Accordion>

## Walkthrough: Using social-contacts

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the SKILL.md file">

Create a file called `SKILL.md` with the following content:

```markdown SKILL.md
---
name: "social-contacts"
description: "Track people the user interacts with — one file per person"
---
# Social Contacts

Maintain a file for each person the user mentions or interacts with.

## File Structure

One file per person, named [first-last].md (lowercase, hyphenated).
Each file has: # [Full Name], ## Basics (Relationship, Role, Company), ## Notes.

## Guidelines

- One person per file — do not combine people
- Only record information explicitly mentioned by the user
- Update existing entries when corrections are provided
- Keep entries factual and concise
```

</Step>

<Step title="Zip and upload the skill">

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os, zipfile, io
from acontext import AcontextClient, FileUpload

client = AcontextClient(api_key=os.getenv("ACONTEXT_API_KEY"))

# Read the SKILL.md you created
with open("SKILL.md", "r") as f:
    skill_md = f.read()

buf = io.BytesIO()
with zipfile.ZipFile(buf, "w") as zf:
    zf.writestr("SKILL.md", skill_md)
buf.seek(0)

skill = client.skills.create(
    file=FileUpload(filename="social-contacts.zip", content=buf.read()),
)
print(f"Created skill: {skill.name} ({skill.id})")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { AcontextClient, FileUpload } from '@acontext/acontext';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import JSZip from 'jszip';

const client = new AcontextClient({
    apiKey: process.env.ACONTEXT_API_KEY,
});

const skillMd = fs.readFileSync("SKILL.md", "utf-8");

const zip = new JSZip();
zip.file("SKILL.md", skillMd);
const zipBuffer = await zip.generateAsync({ type: "nodebuffer" });

const skill = await client.skills.create({
    file: new FileUpload({ filename: "social-contacts.zip", content: zipBuffer }),
});
console.log(`Created skill: ${skill.name} (${skill.id})`);
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Add the skill to a learning space">

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
space = client.learning_spaces.create()
client.learning_spaces.include_skill(space.id, skill_id=skill.id)

skills = client.learning_spaces.list_skills(space.id)
for s in skills:
    print(f"  {s.name}: {s.description}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const space = await client.learningSpaces.create();
await client.learningSpaces.includeSkill({ spaceId: space.id, skillId: skill.id });

const skills = await client.learningSpaces.listSkills(space.id);
for (const s of skills) {
    console.log(`  ${s.name}: ${s.description}`);
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Run a session with mock messages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
session = client.sessions.create()
client.learning_spaces.learn(space.id, session_id=session.id)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Set up a meeting with Alice Chen — she's our new product manager at Acme Corp. She prefers morning slots."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've scheduled a meeting with Alice Chen for tomorrow at 10 AM."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Also remind me that Bob Martinez from the DevOps team helped us fix the staging deploy issue last week."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Noted — Bob Martinez from DevOps helped resolve the staging deployment issue."},
]

for msg in messages:
    client.sessions.store_message(session.id, blob=msg)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const session = await client.sessions.create();
await client.learningSpaces.learn({ spaceId: space.id, sessionId: session.id });

const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Set up a meeting with Alice Chen — she's our new product manager at Acme Corp. She prefers morning slots." },
    { role: "assistant", content: "I've scheduled a meeting with Alice Chen for tomorrow at 10 AM." },
    { role: "user", content: "Also remind me that Bob Martinez from the DevOps team helped us fix the staging deploy issue last week." },
    { role: "assistant", content: "Noted — Bob Martinez from DevOps helped resolve the staging deployment issue." },
];

for (const msg of messages) {
    await client.sessions.storeMessage(session.id, msg);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Learning is asynchronous. After the session's tasks complete, the learner reads your `SKILL.md` and creates files like `alice-chen.md` and `bob-martinez.md` following your rules.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect what the learner created">

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
client.learning_spaces.wait_for_learning(space.id, session_id=session.id)

skills = client.learning_spaces.list_skills(space.id)
for s in skills:
    if s.name == "social-contacts":
        for f in s.file_index:
            if f.path == "SKILL.md":
                continue
            print(f"\n--- {f.path} ---")
            content = client.skills.get_file(skill_id=s.id, file_path=f.path)
            print(content.content.raw)
```

```typescript TypeScript
await client.learningSpaces.waitForLearning({ spaceId: space.id, sessionId: session.id });

const updatedSkills = await client.learningSpaces.listSkills(space.id);
for (const s of updatedSkills) {
    if (s.name === "social-contacts") {
        for (const f of s.fileIndex) {
            if (f.path === "SKILL.md") continue;
            console.log(`\n--- ${f.path} ---`);
            const content = await client.skills.getFile({ skillId: s.id, filePath: f.path });
            console.log(content.content?.raw);
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Expected output — files created by the learner following your SKILL.md rules:

```markdown alice-chen.md
# Alice Chen

## Basics
- Relationship: colleague
- Role: Product Manager
- Company: Acme Corp

## Notes
- Prefers morning meeting slots
```

```markdown bob-martinez.md
# Bob Martinez

## Basics
- Relationship: colleague
- Role: DevOps team

## Notes
- Helped resolve a staging deployment issue
```
