description: "Manage and organize tools that agents have learned and used across your projects"

The Tools API allows you to manage and organize the tools that agents have learned and used within your Acontext projects. You can view all available tools and rename them for better organization and consistency.

## List every tool agent have used before

Retrieve a comprehensive list of all tools that have been used by agents in your project, along with usage statistics.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from acontext import AcontextClient

client = AcontextClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("ACONTEXT_API_KEY"),
)

# If you're using self-hosted Acontext:
# client = AcontextClient(
#     base_url="http://localhost:8029/api/v1",
#     api_key="sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token",
# )

# Get all tool names with usage statistics
tools = client.tools.get_tool_name()

for tool in tools:
    print(f"{tool.name} (used in {tool.sop_count} SOPs)")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { AcontextClient } from '@acontext/acontext';

const client = new AcontextClient({
    apiKey: process.env.ACONTEXT_API_KEY,
});

// If you're using self-hosted Acontext:
// const client = new AcontextClient({
//     baseUrl: "http://localhost:8029/api/v1",
//     apiKey: "sk-ac-your-root-api-bearer-token",
// });

// Get all tool names with usage statistics
const tools = await client.tools.getToolName();

for (const tool of tools) {
    console.log(`${tool.name} (used in ${tool.sop_count} SOPs)`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>


<Info>
The `sop_count` field indicates how many Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) reference each tool, helping you understand tool usage patterns across your project.

## Rename tools at once

Rename multiple tools simultaneously to maintain consistency and improve organization across your project. This is particularly useful when standardizing tool names or updating naming conventions.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from acontext import AcontextClient

client = AcontextClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("ACONTEXT_API_KEY"),
)

# Rename multiple tools at once
result = client.tools.rename_tool_name(
    rename=[
        {"old_name": "calculate", "new_name": "calculate_math"},
        {"old_name": "search", "new_name": "search_web"},
        {"old_name": "file_reader", "new_name": "read_file"}
    ]
)

if result.status == 0:
    print("Tools renamed successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result.errmsg}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { AcontextClient } from '@acontext/acontext';

const client = new AcontextClient({
    apiKey: process.env.ACONTEXT_API_KEY,
});

// Rename multiple tools at once
const result = await client.tools.renameToolName({
    rename: [
        { oldName: 'calculate', newName: 'calculate_math' },
        { oldName: 'search', newName: 'search_web' },
        { oldName: 'file_reader', newName: 'read_file' }
    ]
});

if (result.status === 0) {
    console.log('Tools renamed successfully');
} else {
    console.log(`Error: ${result.errmsg}`);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Renaming tools will update all references across your project's SOPs. Make sure the new names follow your project's naming conventions and don't conflict with existing tools.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming patterns for your tools. Consider prefixes like `web_`, `file_`, or `calc_` to group related functionality.
</Tip>

<Note>
Tool names are case-sensitive and should follow standard identifier conventions (alphanumeric characters and underscores).
</Note>
