title: "What is Skill Memory?"

Skill memory is Acontext's approach to agent memory: instead of opaque embeddings or unstructured text, your agents store memory as **skill files** — plain markdown organized by configurable schemas you control.

## The Problem with Traditional AI Memory

Most agent memory systems fall into three categories — vector stores, knowledge graphs, and plain-text memory (used by products like Mem0 and Letta). They all share common limitations:

- **Vector stores** encode memory as embeddings you can't inspect, edit, or version control
- **Knowledge graphs** require complex schemas upfront and are hard to modify once built
- **Plain-text files** are readable and filesystem-native, but lack organization and indexing — agents struggle to quickly find what they need as memory grows
- **Common pain point**: you can't inspect what your agent actually learned, control how memory is structured, or integrate it into your existing dev workflow

## Skill Memory — A Different Approach

Acontext organizes agent memory as **skills** — file collections where each skill has:

- A **SKILL.md** that defines its schema, purpose, and guidelines
- **Data files** in plain markdown, organized by the skill's own rules

For example:
- `daily-logs` — one file per day, capturing what happened
- `user-general-facts` — one file per topic, storing user preferences
- Domain SOPs — structured procedures the agent learned from past runs

## Three Advantages

| Advantage | What it means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Filesystem-compatible** | Skills are real files — mount in sandboxes, sync to disk, version control, `cat` and `grep` them |
| **Configurable** | Each SKILL.md defines its own schema — you control how memory is organized, not the platform |
| **Human-friendly** | Plain markdown files — read, edit, review, and audit your agent's memory directly |

## Comparison

| | Skill Memory (Acontext) | Vector Store | Knowledge Graph | Plain-text Files |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Storage format | Markdown files | Embeddings | Nodes & edges | Text files |
| Human-readable | Yes | No | Partially | Partially |
| Configurable schema | Yes (SKILL.md) | No | Complex upfront | No |
| Filesystem-native | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Version controllable | Yes | No | No | No |
