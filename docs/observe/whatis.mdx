title: What is Agent Observability?
description: "Understand what your agent does, how it performs, and where it fails"
---

Acontext observes your agent's conversations in the background — extracting tasks, detecting success or failure, and recording progress — so you always know what your agent is doing without writing any tracking code.

## How It Works

When your agent stores messages in Acontext, a background monitor automatically:

1. **Extracts tasks** from the conversation — when an agent says "My plan is: 1. Search, 2. Create, 3. Deploy", each step becomes a trackable task
2. **Detects success or failure** — based on agent behavior, error signals, user confirmation, or task abandonment
3. **Records progress** — what the agent actually did at each step, with specific details like file paths and API calls
4. **Captures user preferences** — requirements and constraints the user mentioned during the conversation

You don't need to instrument your agent. Just store messages, and Acontext handles the rest.

## Task Lifecycle

```
pending → running → success
                  → failed → running (retry)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Task identified but not started |
| `running` | Agent is actively working on it |
| `success` | Confirmed complete — agent moved on without errors, or user confirmed |
| `failed` | Explicit errors, user abandonment, or user reported failure |

## What Gets Extracted

Each task contains:

- **Description** — what the user asked for, in their own words
- **Status** — current lifecycle state
- **Progress** — step-by-step record of what the agent did
- **User preferences** — requirements the user mentioned

<Note>
Tasks represent **user requests**, not agent execution steps. "Book a restaurant in SF" is one task — the agent's sub-steps (search, compare, reserve) are recorded as progress within that task.
</Note>

## Feeds Into Self-Learning

When a task reaches `success` or `failed`, it can feed into the [self-learning pipeline](/learn/self-learning). Acontext distills the outcome into structured analysis:

- **Success** → extracts the approach, key decisions, and generalizable patterns
- **Failure** → extracts the failure point, flawed reasoning, and prevention principles

These analyses become reusable agent skills automatically.
