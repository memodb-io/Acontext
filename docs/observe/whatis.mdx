title: What is Mid-term State?
description: "Automatic task tracking, progress recording, and session summaries — zero instrumentation"
---

Store messages → Acontext automatically extracts tasks, tracks progress, and detects success/failure. No tracking code needed.

## 30-Second Example

Your agent stores a conversation where the user asks: *"Deploy the new API to staging"*

Acontext's background monitor extracts:

```
Task: "Deploy the new API to staging"
Status: success
Progress:
  1. Built Docker image from Dockerfile
  2. Pushed to registry at gcr.io/my-project/api:v2.1
  3. Deployed to staging cluster via kubectl
User preferences:
  1. Always run tests before deploying
```

You didn't write any of that. It came from the conversation automatically.

## What Gets Tracked

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Task** | "Deploy the new API to staging" |
| **Status** | `pending` → `running` → `success` or `failed` |
| **Progress** | Step-by-step record of what the agent did |
| **User preferences** | Constraints the user mentioned |

## Feeds Into Long-term Skill

Completed tasks feed into the [long-term skill pipeline](/learn/quick):

- **Success** → extracts the approach and generalizable patterns
- **Failure** → extracts the failure point and prevention principles

These become reusable agent skills automatically.
