description: "Acontext will batch process the messages in the session to optimize costs."

## Wait until it's full
Acontext will start to process the messages once the buffer is full (*i.e.* unprocessed message turns >= `PROJECT_SESSION_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MAX_TURNS`)

## Wait until it's IDLE
Acontext will start to process the messages once the buffer is IDLE for a while (*i.e.* no new messages for `PROJECT_SESSION_MESSAGE_BUFFER_TTL_SECONDS` seconds)
