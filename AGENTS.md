# Acontext
Acontext is a platform for building AI agents with persistent context, observability, and self-learning capabilities.

## NAVIGATION GUIDE
- Python SDK: `src/client/acontext-py/`
- TypeScript SDK: `src/client/acontext-ts/`
- CLI Tool: `src/client/acontext-cli/`
- API: `src/server/api/`
- CORE: `src/server/core/`
- DASHBOARD: `src/server/ui/`
- Docs: `docs/`

## MODULES
- API is the main module that handles the API requests and responses to Acontext, SDKs are the client-side modules that interact with the API. 
- CLI tool is a command-line tool that helps you deploy Acontext locally and download examples
- CORE contains the session buffer, task extraction, embedding, agent... anything involving AI/LLM/Agent in it.
- API and CORE are connected by message queue.
- API: Go + Gin + GORM/PostgreSQL + Redis + RabbitMQ + S3 + OpenTelemetry + Swagger
- CORE: Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis + RabbitMQ + S3 + OpenAI/Anthropic + OpenTelemetry

## RULES
### Find SDKs after modifying API
When your task is about modify API, always look for the revelant SDKs and see it should be updated.
### Find Document after modifying SDKs
When your task is about implement/update SDKs at `src/client`, always look for the revelant documents and see it should be updated.
DON't update openapi.json, or swagger.json/yaml. those are artifacts generated by programs, no need to manually edit them.
### Sync ORMs between API and CORE
Both API and CORE have their ORMs, which should be synced. CORE uses SQLAlchemy, API uses GORM.
