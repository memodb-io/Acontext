# Acontext
Acontext is a platform for building AI agents with persistent context, observability, and self-learning capabilities.

## NAVIGATION GUIDE
- Python SDK: `src/client/acontext-py/`
- TypeScript SDK: `src/client/acontext-ts/`
- CLI Tool: `src/client/acontext-cli/`
- API: `src/server/api/`
- CORE: `src/server/core/`
- DASHBOARD: `src/server/ui/`
- Docs: `docs/`

## MODULES
- API is the main module that handles the API requests and responses to Acontext, SDKs are the client-side modules that interact with the API. 
- CLI tool is a command-line tool that helps you deploy Acontext locally and download examples
- CORE contains the session buffer, task extraction, embedding, agent... anything involving AI/LLM/Agent in it.
- API and CORE are connected by message queue.
- API: Go + Gin + GORM/PostgreSQL + Redis + RabbitMQ + S3 + OpenTelemetry + Swagger
- CORE: Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL + pgvector + Redis + RabbitMQ + S3 + OpenAI/Anthropic + OpenTelemetry

## RULES
### Confirm API Schemas before actually implementing them
When you're asked to implement new api endpoints, always lay out the api schema first to let user confirm the input and output are correct.
### Update SDKs after modifying API if necessary
When your task is about modify API, always look for the revelant SDKs and see it should be updated.
- Make sure you update both sync and async sdk in python if updated.
### Find Document after modifying SDKs
When your task is about implement/update SDKs at `src/client`, always look for the revelant documents and see it should be updated.
DON't update openapi.json, or swagger.json/yaml. those are artifacts generated by programs, no need to manually edit them.
### Sync ORMs between API and CORE
Both API and CORE have their ORMs, which should be synced. CORE uses SQLAlchemy, API uses GORM.
